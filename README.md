# simplecolorpicker
A simple color picker tool for Windows platforms. Simply activate and pick any colors from the screen.

Sometimes I needed to get some color from the screen. I used to screenshot the screen, load my graphics editing software and then pick the color. This started to be very annoying when I need to work with a lot of images and I needed to color match them. 

How it works: simply activate it and you will a tooltip next to your mouse with the color you are on now. Click it the mouse and the color is coppied to the clipboard.
